                <h3>Baby's Brain Develops</h3>
                <img src="./assets/photos/brain.png"></img>
                <p>
                    Hearing words helps to build a rich network of words in a baby's brain. Kids whose parents talk and read to them often know more words by age 2 than children who have not been read to. And kids who are read to during their early years are more likely to learn to read at the right time.
